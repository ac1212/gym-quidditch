# gym-quidditch

This package provides an [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment for playing [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch) as the ~~seeker~~ ~~chaser~~ ~~keeper~~ ~~beater~~ golden snitch!

Outwit the seeker and fly around as long as you can without exiting the pitch or being caught.

## Overall Idea

The plan is to add another environment where we play as the seeker (heavier, slower acceleration, higher top speed than golden snitch). So now you have two adversarial agents, opening up some fun possibilities!
