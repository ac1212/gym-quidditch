## gym_quidditch:quidditch-snitch-v0
Play [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch) as the ~~seeker~~ ~~chaser~~ ~~keeper~~ ~~beater~~ golden snitch!

Outwit the seeker and fly around as long as you can without being caught.

## gym_quidditch:quidditch-snitch-v0
Play [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch) as the seeker. Catch the snitch as fast as you can.


# Overall Idea

You have two adversarial agents--the seeker and the golden snitch--opening up some fun possibilities! I'll set up a new environment where the actions for both the seeker and the golden snitch can be provided.
